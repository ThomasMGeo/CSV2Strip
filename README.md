Script to make a strip log from an abbreviated CSV

Depends on striplog (Agile Scientific)
https://github.com/agile-geoscience/striplog

Goal of strip log is to have an abbriviated CSV file with top, bottom and formation information. Because of top and bottom information, these are descrete packages and not all of the core or outcrop needs to be described. Sample .csv file is provided, along with descriptions. Can add as many formations as you want!


The CSV file can be use for further machine learning training studies.
